<p>What ever happened to predictability? The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there's a heart, a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go. There's a face of somebody who needs you.
Everywhere you look, when you're lost out there and you're all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home, Everywhere you look. Everywhere you look.</p>

<p>Overture, curtains, lights. This is it, the night of nights. No more rehearsing and nursing a part, we know every part by heart! Overture, curtains, lights. This is it, you'll hit the heights. And oh, what heights we'll hit. On with the show this is it. Tonight what heights we'll hit, on with the show this is it!</p>

<p>There once was a story about a man who could turn invisible. I thought it was only a story... until it happened to me. Ok, so here's how it works: there's this stuff called Quicksilver that can bend light. Some scientist made it into a synthetic gland, and that's where I came in. See, I was facing life in prison and they were looking for a human experiment. So, we made a deal. They put the gland in my brain; I walk free. The operation was a success... but that's where everything started to go wrong.</p>
