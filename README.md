# Open Source Codeigniter Authentication.

A complete web sample and template of a secure authentication system using the Codeigniter PHP framework. Very simple configuration, as most of it has been done in this sample.


## Authored by: envysea.com

## Demo available at envysea.com/showcase/openm

## Requirements

PHP version 5.1.6 or newer.

## Changes

Updated to CodeIgniter 2.1.0

## Intro and Notes

1.	Cross-site request forgery protection (CSRF)
2.	Protects against cross-site scripting (XSS)
3. 	Encrypted Cookies and sessions are securely stored in the database
4.	Utilizes query bindings and active records -- all queries are escaped
5.	Site is divided into three sections: normal pages, secure pages, and admin pages
6.	Windows 8 Developer Preview 8102 will have problems logging in
7.	Remember me cookies/persistent login deliberately left out, message me for the code if you would like it


## Installation Instructions

###	Installing

1.	Unzip package
2.	Upload entire folders to server
3.	Create a database on your server, import envysea.sql (phpMyAdmin)
4.	Go to application/config/config.php
5.	Change $config['base_url'] to your base URL
6.	Change $config['encryption_key'] to a completely random character string (random means random -- uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol, etc. and do not leave it as the current value)
7.	Go to application/config/envysea.php and make all changes between the comment blocks
8.	Open application/config/database.php and enter your database paramters (username, password, database)
9.	Open site and enjoy

###	Creating your users

There are two users by default - username: "admindude", password: "admindude" and username: "normaldude", password: "normaldude" - We are going to delete both of them and create your own separate to your site

1.  Delete all users from database
2.  Open application/config/envysea.php, change "salty_salt" and "admin_level" to a random character string unique to your site
3.  Go to the webpage, and create two new users
4.  Go into your database and change the user_level of the user you want to be an admin to equal your new admin_level
5.  You are now 100% done with the installation and have a fully featured membership site unique and secure to you

##	Documentation

### To be continued

The "module" variable is just a way for you to distinguish which header and footer you want to use when loading views:
-	Use the envysea module when loading views for all normal access websites
-	Use the secure module when loading views for all secure pages
-	Use the admin module when loading views for all admin pages

The construct of controllers require:
-	Nothing (no code) for normal pages
-	$this->auth->is_logged_in() for secure pages
-	$this->auth->is_logged_in() and $this->auth->is_admin() for admin pages

Auth Library
-	The create function in the auth library is shared between the normal user registration and the admin create a person views
-	The update function in the auth library is shared between the normal user account update and the admin update a person views
-	The delete function in the auth library is shared between the normal user account delete and the admin update a person views
